# Text Adventure game
This will be a bigger project, but for my first beginnner project, i will create a text adventure game. One of the things i struggled with following along codecademy's intro to computer science course was object oriented programming. To understand this better i figured i would make a simple terminal game that uses classes for users, items, etc.

## requirements
- Make the game a dungeon-crawler
    - make at least 9 rooms
    - Space station theme
- have a small story to it
    - around an hour to complete 
    - power has mysteriously shut down, player has to restore it
    - Small puzzles of different kinds to solve
    - add a couple antagonists, maybe 2 crew are spies you have to defeat.
- can pick up items and weapons, each has unique uses
- displays a visual of the room you are in
